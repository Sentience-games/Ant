TODO

Consider moving everything that touches the game from terminated to lenght based strings
Rewrite the file handling system
Win32MainWindowProc catches WM_INPUT messages
The application crashes without an error log when the data directory is not found
Set viewport dimensions and implement restricted resizing of the window. This seems to be problematic on windows
Refactor input handling to allow hot plugging of devices
memory usage shadowing
/// render prep batch sorting
//// API agnostic rendering of prepped rendering batches
//// Cleanup renderer
/// Figure out what to do with static objects and how they should interact with entities

// Rewamp the asset system to support replacement tags and smart ordering, such that modifying the base content is smoother

Rewrite asset files that are tagged as "wrong_endian" at startup and reload those files

//// REMOVE STDARG FROM STRING.H

//// Verify that the function 'WideCharToMultiByte' is used correctly in 'Win32GetAllFilesOfTypeBegin' 'Win32GetFileInfo'
